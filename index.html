          <h2>About Daft Punk</h2>
          <p>
            Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris
            by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved
            early popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house
            movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco,
            techno, rock and synth-pop. They are regarded as one of the most
            influential acts in dance music.

          <h2>Daft Punk History</h2>
          <p>
            Daft Punk formed after Bangalter and de Homem-Christo's indie rock
            band, Darlin', disbanded. Their debut album, Homework, was released
            by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles
            "Around the World" and "Da Funk". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot
            personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to
            disguise their identities. They made few media appearances. They
            were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed
            Banger Records.
